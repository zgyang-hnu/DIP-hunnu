# DIP
This repo. provides the code used for "Domain-invariant prototypes for semantic segmentation"

# Train
Before running the trainDIP.py, activate the corresponding dataloader for different adaptation task

# Test
For domain adaptation, you should run the getsupp_pro.py to obtain the offline class prototypes and then run testDIP.py on the corresponding test dataset

# Pre-trained VGG ResNet
The pre-trained VGG ResNet can be downloaded at
